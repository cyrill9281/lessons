This 2nd quarter has been a struggle for me cause i just can't seem to understand the lessons, well I mean i could memorize the definitions and stuff for the tests but when it comes to coding my brain just cant take it hehe. I really do try to practice but i still find it a hard time to remember the tags and all those sort of stuff. But I would like to thank my friends for helping me try to understand the lessons even if i coud get really annoying at times. and ofcourse ms Uminga for teaching us all the lessons that we could use for our codes.</p>
